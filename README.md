# Household Energy Usage Forecast
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

## Problem Statement:

In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.
By the end of this project, learners should provide actionable insights into energy usage trends and deliver a predictive model that can help optimize energy consumption for households or serve as a baseline for further research into energy management systems.

## Business Use Cases:

Energy Management for Households: Monitor energy usage, reduce bills, and promote energy-efficient habits.
Demand Forecasting for Energy Providers: Predict demand for better load management and pricing strategies.
Anomaly Detection: Identify irregular patterns indicating faults or unauthorized usage.
Smart Grid Integration: Enable predictive analytics for real-time energy optimization.
Environmental Impact: Reduce carbon footprints and support conservation initiatives.
